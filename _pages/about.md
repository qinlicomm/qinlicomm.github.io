Welcome! I am a Preparing Future Faculty Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Communication](https://communication.missouri.edu/ "Department of Communication") at the University of Missouri. 

***My research examines how various communication technologies contribute to misinformation susceptibility, political radicalization, and identity-based participation in media, interpersonal, and social contexts.  As a computational social scientist, I use large-scale data (i.e., web and app tracking data, social media data, panel surveys, geographic data) and advanced statistical and computing methods (e.g., network analysis, machine learning models, mathematical and agent-based models). My research has appeared in top-tier communication journals and multi-disciplinary journals including ***Journal of Communication*** , ***Human Communication Research***, and ***PLOS ONE***. 

In my dissertation, I developed a novel trust-based theory of factual beliefs and (mis)information sharing in social contexts and design web-based interactive experiments with bots incorporating behavioral trust games to test my theory. I received [Lynda Lee Kaid Outstanding Dissertation Award at National Communication Associationâ€™s Political Communication Division](https://www.natcom.org/nca-awards/2025-interest-group-award-winners/) in 2025.

I am Faculty Research Associate of Political Communication Institute (PCI) and The Media and Diversity Center (MDC) at the University of Missouri, as well as student alumnus of [Violence, Ideology, and Extremism (VIEW) Working Group](https://mershoncenter.osu.edu/VIEW "Violence, Ideology, and Extremism (VIEW) Working Group") and [Computational and Statistical Models group (COSMOS)](https://osu-cosmos.group/ "Computational and Statistical Models group (COSMOS)") at The Ohio State.

I obtained my M.A. degree in Communication at Washington State University and a B.A. degree in Journalism (with a concentration on Information Science and Technology) at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. Prior to the graduate program, I interned as a reporter and a data journalist. You can also find my CV [here](https://qinlicomm.github.io/assets/pdf/Qin_Li_Public_CV.pdf "here").

I spend my spare time wandering in nature, meditating at yoga studios, getting lost in books, dancing, and sketching. I believe in KINDNESS.
