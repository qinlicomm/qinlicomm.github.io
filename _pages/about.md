Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [School of Communication](https://comm.osu.edu/ "School of Communication") at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/ "The Ohio State University"). My research lies at the intersection of political communication and computational methods. 

My research focuses on the impact of the information and social environment on factual beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. In my research, I frequently use and combine various data and methods, including panel surveys, digital trace data, geographic data, and behavioral experiments. My dissertation builds on this line of research and uses a multi-stage network experiment to examine network effects on factual beliefs and misinformation sharing. My other work involves using computational methods such as network analysis and text analysis to answer social science questions.

My work has been published in ***Journal of Communication***, ***Human Communication Research***, and ***Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Misinformation Review***. Check out this [page](https://qinlicomm.github.io/research/ "page") for more info.

I am affiliated with Computational and Statistical Models group ([COSMOS](https://osu-cosmos.group/ "COSMOS")), Communication and Politics group, and Communicating Science, Health, Environment, and Risk (ComSHER) at OSU. 

I obtained my M.A. degree in Communication at Washington State University and a B.A. degree in Journalism at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. Prior to the graduate program, I interned as a reporter and a data journalist.

Below you will find my email address and social media accounts. Please reach out to me if you are interested in my work or wanted to chat :) You can also find my CV [here](https://qinlicomm.github.io/assets/pdf/Qin_Li_Public_CV.pdf "here").
