Welcome! I am a Preparing Future Faculty Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Communication](https://communication.missouri.edu/ "Department of Communication") at the University of Missouri. I got my PhD degree in Communication at the Ohio State University in 2024, where I was co-advised by Dr. [Kelly Garrett]{https://comm.osu.edu/people/garrett.258} and Dr. [Robert Bond]{https://comm.osu.edu/people/bond.136}.

***My research examines how various communication technologies contribute to misinformation susceptibility, political radicalization, and identity-based participation in media, interpersonal, and social contexts.  As a computational social scientist, I use large-scale data (i.e., web and app tracking data, social media data, panel surveys, geographic data) and advanced statistical and computational methods (e.g., network analysis, machine learning models, mathematical and agent-based models) to advance theories and methods in communication research. My research has appeared in top-tier communication journals and multi-disciplinary journals including ***Journal of Communication*** , ***Human Communication Research***, and ***PLOS ONE***. 

In my dissertation, I developed a trust-based theory of factual beliefs and (mis)information sharing in social contexts and designed web-based interactive experiments incorporating behavioral trust games with bots to test my theory. In recognition of my theoretical and methodological contributions, I received the [Lynda Lee Kaid Outstanding Dissertation Award at National Communication Associationâ€™s Political Communication Division](https://www.natcom.org/nca-awards/2025-interest-group-award-winners/) in 2025.

I am Faculty Research Associate of [Political Communication Institute (PCI)]{https://communication.missouri.edu/political-communication-institute} and [The Media and Diversity Center (MDC)]{https://communication.missouri.edu/media-and-diversity-center} at the University of Missouri, as well as student alumnus of [Violence, Ideology, and Extremism (VIEW) Working Group](https://mershoncenter.osu.edu/VIEW "Violence, Ideology, and Extremism (VIEW) Working Group") and [Computational and Statistical Models group (COSMOS)](https://osu-cosmos.group/ "Computational and Statistical Models group (COSMOS)") at The Ohio State.

I obtained my M.A. degree in Communication at Washington State University and a B.A. degree in Journalism (with a concentration on Information Science and Technology) at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. Prior to the graduate program, I interned as an investigative journalist at Jiefang Daily---he largest print media in Shanghai---and a data journalist at [Caixin Media]{https://www.caixinglobal.com/}---one of the most influential financial media in China. 

You can find my CV [here](https://qinlicomm.github.io/assets/pdf/Qin_Li_Public_CV.pdf "here").

I spend my spare time wandering in nature, meditating at yoga studios, getting lost in books, dancing, and sketching. I believe in KINDNESS.
