Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [School of Communication](https://comm.osu.edu/ "School of Communication") at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/ "The Ohio State University"). My research lies at the intersection of political communication and computational methods. 

My primary research focuses on the impact of the information and social environment on factual beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. In my research, I frequently use and combine various data and methods, including panel surveys, digital trace data, network data, behavioral experiments, geographic data, and text data, to provide compelling evidence. In my dissertation, I develop dyadic and triadic online experiments to examine how dyadic trust and network closure impact factual beliefs and (mis)information sharing, providing novel insights on the social contexts of (mis)information exposure. 

My work has been published in ***Journal of Communication***, ***Human Communication Research***, and ***Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Misinformation Review***. Check out this [page](https://qinlicomm.github.io/research/ "page") for more info.

I am affiliated with Computational and Statistical Models group ([COSMOS](https://osu-cosmos.group/ "COSMOS")), Communication and Politics group, and Communicating Science, Health, Environment, and Risk (ComSHER) at OSU. 

I obtained my M.A. degree in Communication at Washington State University and a B.A. degree in Journalism at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. Prior to the graduate program, I interned as a reporter and a data journalist.
