Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [School of Communication](https://comm.osu.edu/ "School of Communication") at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/ "The Ohio State University"). My research lies at the intersection of political communication and computational methods. 

My primary research area is the role of the information and social environment in explaining factual beliefs or misperceptions. To do so, I have combined various data and methods, including panel surveys and digital trace data, as well as computational methods such as web-scraping and text analysis, to provide more compelling, causal evidence. My dissertation builds on this line of research and uses a multi-stage network experiment to examine network effects on factual beliefs.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in [Journal of Communication](https://doi.org/10.1093/joc/jqad017 "Journal of Communication"), **Human Communication Research**, and [Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Misinformation Review](https://doi.org/10.37016/mr-2020-59 "Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Misinformation Review"), and is under review in various social science and general science journals. Check out this [page](https://qinlicomm.github.io/research/ "page") for more info.

I am affiliated with Computational and Statistical Models group ([COSMOS](https://osu-cosmos.group/ "COSMOS")),  Communication and Politics group, and Communicating Science, Health, Environment, and Risk (ComSHER) at OSU. 

I obtained my M.A. degree in Communication at Washington State University and a B.A. degree in Journalism at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. Prior to the graduate program, I interned as a reporter and a data journalist.

Below you will find my email address and social media accounts. Please reach out to me if you are interested in my work and wanted to chat :) You can also find my CV [here](https://qinlicomm.github.io/cv/ "here").
