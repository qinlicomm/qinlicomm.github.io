Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [School of Communication](https://comm.osu.edu/ "School of Communication") at The Ohio State University. My research lies at the intersection of political communication and computational social science. 

The main focus of my research pertains to the role of the information environment and citizens' social environment in explaining public opinion, and particularly, their factual beliefs. Specifically, I seek to explore what factors in the information environment--ranging from state-level contexts, political campaigns, to social media use--and individuals' social environment--including partisan segregation and network characteristics--explain individuals' factual beliefs and attitudes. To do so, I have combined various methods and data, including panel surveys and digital trace data, as well as tools of computational social science such as web-scraping and text analysis, to provide more compelling, causal evidence. My dissertation builds on this line of research and uses a network experiment to examine how network characteristics lead to social influence on factual beliefs.

My secondary research area relates to the structure and characteristics of social networks and the implications for individuals' attitudes. In my prior work, I have combined social media data and survey data and leveraged network tools to understand these relationships.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in _Journal of Communication_ and _Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Misinformation Review_, or under review in various communication and general science journals.

I am affiliated with Computational and Statistical Models group ([COSMOS](https://osu-cosmos.group/ "COSMOS")) and Communication and Politics. 

I obtained my M.A. degree in Communication at Washington State University in Pullman, WA of the United States and a B.A. degree in Journalism from School of Journalism at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. Prior to the graduate programs, I worked as journalism interns as a reporter and a data journalist.
