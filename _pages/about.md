Welcome! I am a [PFFIE](https://gradschool.missouri.edu/postdoctoral-education/pffie/ "PFFIE") Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Communication](https://communication.missouri.edu/ "Department of Communication") at the University of Missouri. 

I combine traditional quantitative methods with computational methods to answer questions on political communication. Specifically, I study how both the information and social environment impact factual beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. In my work, I frequently use and combine various data and methods, including panel surveys, digital trace data, network data, behavioral experiments, geographic data, and text data. In my dissertation, I developed dyadic and triadic online experiments to examine how dyadic trust and network closure impact factual beliefs and (mis)information sharing, providing novel insights on the social contexts of (mis)information exposure. My ongoing research involves developing computational methods to detect identity-based disinformation, leveraging NLP to study online discussion about race, dehumanization and stereotypes in traditional media, among others.

My work has been published in ***Journal of Communication***, ***Human Communication Research***, ***PLOS ONE***, and ***Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Misinformation Review***. Check out this [page](https://qinlicomm.github.io/research/ "page") or my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lnD4HU4AAAAJ&hl=en "Google Scholar profile") for more info.

I am affiliated with Political Communication Institute (PCI) and The Media and Diversity Center (MDC) at the University of Missouri, as well as [Violence, Ideology, and Extremism (VIEW) Working Group](https://mershoncenter.osu.edu/VIEW "Violence, Ideology, and Extremism (VIEW) Working Group") and [Computational and Statistical Models group (COSMOS)](https://osu-cosmos.group/ "Computational and Statistical Models group (COSMOS)") at The Ohio State.

I obtained my M.A. degree in Communication at Washington State University and a B.A. degree in Journalism at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. Prior to the graduate program, I interned as a reporter and a data journalist. You can also find my CV [here](https://qinlicomm.github.io/assets/pdf/Qin_Li_Public_CV.pdf "here").
